## To Do
- [X] Add CodeMirror
- [X] Add a play button
- [X] Add local storage support
- [X] Ensure deleting works
- [X] Fix tempo: a beat should be a beat not a second: most places the word beat is used in the code, it should actually be `time`, with the beat to time translation happening soon after we determine whether we're playing on a particular beat.
- [X] Improve what parser.
- [X] Add Metadata/setup block capability: i.e. tempo, etc.
- [ ] Prevent the clock from running out
- [ ] Add more instruments
- [ ] Add an instrument block

## Maybe
